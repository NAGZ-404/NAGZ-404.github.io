            <td>I volunteered at my local library in the coding club that aimed to teach languages such Python to young children. I attended every weekend and helped set up equipment such as keyboard and Raspberry Pis for the kids to use when they came around. Then I helped anyone struggling with a task or does not understand a piece of code. I then helped clean up at the end of the club for the day and mark anyone who had attended.
                I enjoyed helping others understand concepts and teach coding. Making me believe engaging with people is one of my strong suits.

Learning about how professionals work and what type of developmental models they use (such as AGILE).
                There is a lot to learn when adapting to new environments and teamwork is key to settling in, which I learned to be extremely valuable.

            <td>For a weeklong internship I worked at a fintech consulting firm called CAPCO that dealt in creating digital products for clients. We were given case studies to look at, had talks with various industry veterans and what was necessary businesses like CAPCO to strive. A final group project was also assigned to us where we had to consult with “clients” of a bank and design a banking app to suit their needs. I created a mock-up of the app using Photoshop and presented the concept along with my teammates to pitch our idea, which was received favourably. I am fond of using programs such as Photoshop to create media as well as I have developed soft skills such as teamwork further.
